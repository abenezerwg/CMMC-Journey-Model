# CMMC Journey Path: Micro Enterprise (1–10 employees)

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is an unofficial, open-source guide. Use for educational purposes only.

## Overview
- Minimal scope (core systems only, e.g., M365, laptops, cloud services)
- Self-assessment focus (C3PAO optional)
- **3–6 month timeline** (typical for streamlined scope; 12+ months if building from scratch)
- ~$5K–$15K budget (including assessment/certification)
- **Level 1 + select Level 2 controls**

## Recommended Stages

### 1. Discover
- Identify critical business functions
- Contract and obligation mapping
- ROI calculation for compliance

### 2. Scope
- Focus on assets handling CUI
- Minimal or single enclave
- Cloud-first approach

### 3. Assess
- Quick gap analysis using control checklist
- Identify **Level 1 control gaps** and high-priority Level 2 gaps
- Verify alignment with **320 Assessment Objectives (AOs)** in NIST SP 800-171A
- Draft POA&M for missing items

### 4. Implement
- Apply **Level 1 controls first**
- Leverage built-in cloud security (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID, encryption)
- Collect evidence (screenshots, policies, training records, configuration exports)

### 5. Document
- Draft SSP (lightweight, focused on in-scope systems)
- Maintain POA&M with realistic milestones
- Organize evidence repository by control family (AC, AU, CM, etc.)

### 6. Certify
- Self-assessment OR optional C3PAO assessment
- If pursuing formal certification, engage a **Certified CMMC Assessor (CCA)** or **Certified CMMC Professional (CCP)**
- Continuous compliance monitoring and POA&M tracking

## Tips
- Use official NIST 800-171A assessment checklist for accuracy
- Use templates for policies and evidence
- Automate documentation where possible
- Focus on high-impact, low-effort controls
- Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) are required to identify all CUI sources/destinations (per control 3.1.3)
