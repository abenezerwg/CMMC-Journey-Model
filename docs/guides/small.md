# CMMC Journey Path: Small Enterprise (11–50 employees)

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is an unofficial, open-source guide. Use for educational purposes only.

## Overview
- Focused scope (all systems handling CUI)
- Self-assessment or basic C3PAO engagement
- **6–12 month timeline** (typical; accelerated timelines possible with pre-existing security controls)
- ~$15K–$35K budget
- **Level 1 + Level 2 fully, start Level 3 if feasible**

## Recommended Stages

### 1. Discover
- Business case and obligation mapping
- Contract review for CUI handling
- Executive stakeholder alignment

### 2. Scope
- Identify all assets and CUI flows
- Create Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to map CUI sources/destinations
- Consider minimal enclave if multiple systems
- Define assessment boundary

### 3. Assess
- Full gap analysis across Level 1 & Level 2
- Verify coverage of **320 Assessment Objectives (AOs)** per NIST SP 800-171A
- Draft POA&M for gaps
- Prioritize Level 1 controls for immediate remediation

### 4. Implement
- Apply **Level 1 and Level 2 controls**
- Start selected Level 3 controls if budget allows
- Evidence collection (policies, configurations, training records, logs)
- Establish audit logging and monitoring

### 5. Document
- Complete SSP for core systems
- POA&M finalized with realistic timelines
- Evidence organized by control family for C3PAO review

### 6. Certify
- Optional Certified CMMC Professional (CCP) pre-assessment review
- C3PAO formal assessment if required by contract
- Continuous compliance and improvements

## Tips
- Focus on foundational (Level 1) controls first
- Track progress using project management tools (e.g., Jira, Monday.com)
- Budget for external consultation if needed (CCP guidance is cost-effective at this scale)
- Document POA&M justification clearly—simple fixes can be included if properly prioritized
